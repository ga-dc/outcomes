# Week 2: Alumni Panel

## Learning Objectives:

* Gain advice from students who have been through it before

* Get first hand knowledge of ways to be successful at GA and network like a pro

* Find out what alumni wished they had done while in class

## Framing:

We get it, this program is a lot, and can be intimidating. But don’t worry . . . you’re not alone!  Need proof that you will survive and get through this? Talk to those who have survived a GA Immersive and have a job in this field! These expert alums will share their Tips and Tricks. Come prepared with 3 burning questions you would love to know the answer to.

Your career coach will be available at the end of the panel for any 1:1 questions you have.
